# First_API
Hi!
Welcome to my 1st Project on GitHub :) 
Below is an overview of my project to improve my skills in Python

Business Inquiries: hunta.garcia@gmail.com 

Goal: Retrieve stock data with my personal API key from Polygon.io using Juypter Notebook
Status: Complete
Example: Tesla Stock
Scope: Aggregate data (categories listed below) based on start & end dates
        #v = volume, vw = volume weighted average price, o = open, c = close, h = high,  l = low
        #t = Msec timestamp for start of aggregate window, n= number of transactions in aggregate window 
Additional: Visualize data according to each day by creating rows x columns + build out a graph
